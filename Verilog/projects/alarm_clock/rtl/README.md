This folder contains all synthesizable Verilog RTL modules used in the Alarm Clock design. The design is modularized into six RTL blocks, each handling a specific functionality such as timing generation, time counting, alarm configuration, and control logic. Each module is written following good RTL coding practices and is intended to be reusable and easy to integrate. All modules are instantiated and interconnected in the top-level alarm clock module.
