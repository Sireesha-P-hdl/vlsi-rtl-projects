# HDLBits Practice Concepts

This folder contains Verilog implementations of important digital design concepts
practiced as part of HDLBits exercises.
The designs are written independently to reinforce understanding of
combinational logic, sequential circuits, and finite state machines.
These implementations focus on clarity, correctness, and good RTL coding practices.
